                Time Master is a time management app that is based on the principles of Pomodoro Technique, and it helps users manage their daily tasks/work and use time more wisely.
                It is a new way to stay off your phone, focus on your own task, and manage your daily tasks more wisely based on the principles of Pomodoro Technique. 
                You are able to create and organize your day into task blocks so that you can focus on completing them one at a time in a 25-minute time block. 
                You can also join the global ranking and check how many tasks they completed while having interactions (receiving notifications) with them in the global social networks.
